// This example shows how to use the generic API provided by Coinnect.
// This method is useful if you have to iterate throught multiple accounts of
// different exchanges and perform the same operation (such as get the current account's balance)
// You can also use the Coinnect generic API if you want a better error handling since all methods
// return Result<_, Error>.

    // We create a Coinnect Generic API
