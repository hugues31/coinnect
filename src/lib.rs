//!
//! Coinnect is a Rust library aiming to provide a complete access to REST APIs for various
//! crypto-currencies exchanges (see below for a list of supported exchanges).
//! All methods consume HTTPS api. The purpose of this crate is not
//! to stream data (you should use websocket/FIX in that case).
//!
//! For optional parameters, most methods require an empty str (`""`) if you don't want to specify
//! them.
//!
//! ### Exchanges support:
//! - [x] Poloniex
//! - [x] Kraken
//! - [x] Bitstamp (partial)
//!
//! # WARNING
//! This library is highly experimental at the moment. Please do not invest what you
//! can't afford to loose. This is a personal project, I can not be held responsible for
//! the library malfunction, which can lead to a loss of money.

// Move all the clippy warning in deny.
#![deny(clippy)]

// error_chain can make a lot of recursions.
#![recursion_limit="128"]
// Allow lint customization.
#![allow(unknown_lints)]
// Avoid warning for the Crypto-currency about quotes.
